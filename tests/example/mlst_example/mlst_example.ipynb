    "MLST stands for **M**ulti-**l**ocus **s**equence **t**yping. This is a framework most often used to classify bacterial isolates based on a number (ususally 7) of fragments of housekeeping genes. Briefly, each new allele of one of these gene fragments is designated as a number, and a set of 7 such numbers denotes the \"sequence type\" of a sample.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, MLST uses the genes aroE, gdh, gki, recP, spi, xpt, and ddl, which are all genes that code for various housekeeping enzymes.  If you downloaded and looked at the sequence-type (ST) profile data that's used here (which you can do from [PubMLST](https://pubmlst.org/bigsdb?db=pubmlst_spneumoniae_seqdef&page=plugin&name=ProfileExport)), you might see something like the following:  \n",

    "A useful way to estimate how related various STs might be, is to calculate the pairwise hamming distances between the allelic profiles of the STs, i.e., counting the number of alleles that are different between all the pairs of STs. The hamming distance gives us the measure of difference between a given pair of STs, and (7-hamming distance) thus tells us how similar they are. In the two STs shown above, the hamming distance is 4; the two STs differ at the alleles for gdh, spi, xpt, and ddl; and we record the similarity as 3. Doing this for all  of the STs in the data, and then only retaining those ST pairs that are identical at at least 5 loci, we can arrive at the following dataset:  "

    "Pruning is, essentially, a way to simplify the full graph. This is useful when, for example, you want to add a new ST to this graph. In order to do this, you would want to compare the allelic profile of the new ST to that of all of the nodes in the graph. The full graph had 15,068 nodes, but the pruned version has 6473, so in this particular case, less than half the number of pairwise comparisons would be needed. Note that for very large graphs like this one, pruning can take a fair amount of time (it takes about 45 minutes for the MLST graph we are working with here).  "
